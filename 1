Let's walk through each part of the hypothesis testing problem step by step:

---

### **a) What hypotheses should be tested?**

We are testing whether the new engine has a longer average lifetime than the old model (225,000 miles).

* **Null hypothesis (H₀):** μ = 225,000 (no improvement)
* **Alternative hypothesis (H₁):** μ > 225,000 (engine lifetime has increased)

This is a **one-tailed test (right-tailed)**.

---

### **b) Find the probability of a Type I error (α)**

The Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis even though it's true.

We are given:

* Population mean under H₀: μ = 225,000
* Standard deviation: σ = 40,000
* Sample size: n = 16
* Rejection region: $\bar{X} \geq 250,000$

We find the z-score corresponding to the sample mean 250,000:

$$
z = \frac{250,000 - 225,000}{\frac{40,000}{\sqrt{16}}} = \frac{25,000}{10,000} = 2.5
$$

Using the standard normal distribution table:

$$
P(Z \geq 2.5) = 1 - P(Z \leq 2.5) = 1 - 0.9938 = 0.0062
$$

**Answer:** The probability of a Type I error is **0.0062**

---

### **c) Find the probability of a Type II error (β)**

Now suppose that the **true mean is actually 230,000**, with a **standard deviation of 60,000**, and we still use the same rejection region ($\bar{X} \geq 250,000$).

We want:

$$
\beta = P(\bar{X} < 250,000 \mid \mu = 230,000, \sigma = 60,000)
$$

Find the z-score for $\bar{X} = 250,000$ under this **new distribution**:

$$
z = \frac{250,000 - 230,000}{\frac{60,000}{\sqrt{16}}} = \frac{20,000}{15,000} = 1.3333
$$

From the z-table:

$$
P(Z < 1.3333) \approx 0.9082
$$

**Answer:** The probability of a Type II error is **0.9082**
